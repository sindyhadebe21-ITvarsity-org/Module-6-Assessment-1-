                            <h3>KOALAS</h3>
    <p>The koala ‘bear’ is not a bear at all, but a herbivorous marsupial, belonging to the family of mammals which have pouches in which they carry their young.

Cute and cuddly with thick ash grey fur, adult Koalas measure around 33.5 inches (85 cm) and weigh up to 20 pounds (9 kg). Koalas are found in Eastern Australia.</p>
     <p>Koalas are usually between 2 to 3 feet in height and can weigh up to approximately 25 pounds. Other physical characteristics of koalas are their lack of a tail and their long limbs for their body size. Their tail is considered a vestigial structure and is thought to have been lost due to evolutionary adaptation. They also have one of the smallest brain-to-body-weight ratio of any mammal and are not considered to be very intelligent creatures.</p>
   <p>Koalas live in Australia in a variety of habitats from forests to woodlands. Their preferred habitats are forests composed of eucalyptus trees, where they are able to survive very high up in the trees. They are found in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
