                            <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope. Monkeys are divided into the families of New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) and Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae in the strict sense; Catarrhini in the broad sense, which again includes apes).The origin of monkeys – or higher primates – is a contentious subject amongst scientists. A series of fossils found in Egypt led to the commonly held belief that Africa was the original home of anthropoids. Recent discoveries however have suggested that they might have actually originated from Asia. We’ll leave it up to the scientists to debate!</p>
     <p>onkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 millimetres (4.6 in) with a 172-millimetre (6.8 in) tail and just over 100 grams (3.5 oz) in weight, to the male mandrill, almost 1 metre (3.3 ft) long and weighing up to 36 kilograms (79 lb).</p>
   <p>Monkeys live in trees, grasslands, mountains, forests, and on high plains. A group of monkeys is called a troop. Most primates share six basic features: forward-facing eyes, eye sockets, grasping hands, nails, fingerprints, and large brains. Monkeys are most easily distinguished from apes by their tails.Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a monkey? How cool would it be to swing from limb to limb at the tops of the trees, munching leisurely on exotic fruits? However, all the 264 species of monkeys don't actually live in trees! There are actually two major types of monkey habitats: arboreal and terrestrial. Regardless of the type of habitat a monkey lives in, they rarely spend much time in one place, so their nests are pretty basic. Monkeys are constantly on the move, traveling daily to look for food.</p>

    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
