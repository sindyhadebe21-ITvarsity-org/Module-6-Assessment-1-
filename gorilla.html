                            <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
    <p>Gorillas are the world’s largest primates. They are members of the Hominidae family. This family is also known as the ‘Great Ape’ family, and also includes three other types of primate: orangutans, chimpanzees, and humans.Gorillas live in the mountain and lowland forests of Central Africa. They live in small groups, led by a male gorilla known as a ‘Silverback’. The other members of the troop are females and young gorillas.Male gorillas are large, powerful animals, and can grow to be 1.8 m (almost 6 feet) tall, and weigh up to 180 kg (400 lbs). Females are significantly smaller.</p>
     <p>Gorillas have five fingers and toes, just like humans.
Gorillas usually walk on their knuckles and rarely stand up, unless threatened.
Gorillas in captivity have been taught sign language and can even communicate with humans.
Gorillas and humans are both primates. In fact, many scientists see a lot of similarity between humans and gorillas.
A family of gorillas is called a troop.
Gorillas have fingerprints just like humans do. They can also be identified by their nose prints, each one is unique.
Gorillas make nests on the ground or in trees to sleep in.</p>
