    <p>a wild African hog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus) that has large protruding tusks and in the male two pairs of rough warty excrescences on the face and that is sometimes placed in two separate species (P. aethiopicus and P. africanus).Warthog are found in moist and arid savannas avoiding deserts and high mountains. The comical, but robust warthog can be seen at many of the South African game parks.</p>
     <p>A warthog is a large member of the pig family and a close cousin of the wild boar. They are dark brown in color and mostly hairless, aside from a mane that runs from their head to the middle of their back. Their most distinctive features are their four sharp tusks and the thick, bumpy pads or “warts” on their faces.Common Warthogs have a height between 25”-33” (64-84 cm), body length of 36”-60” (91-152 cm), and an overall weight in the range of 120-250 lb (55-110 k)g. The lifespan of a Common Warthog is typically 15-18 years in the wild, or up to 20 years in captivity.</p>
   <p>Habits and Lifestyle Common warthogs are social animals and live in groups called sounders. Females live in sounders with their young and with other females. Females tend to stay in their natal groups, while males leave, but stay within the home range.</p>
