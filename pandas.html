                            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
    <p>Giant pandas (often referred to as simply “pandas”) are black and white bears. In the wild, they are found in thick bamboo forests, high up in the mountains of central ChinaGiant Panda Facts Length: Average is 5 to 6 feet for males, slightly less for females. Tail length: About one half foot (6 inches). Height: Average is 2 to 3 feet for males, about half a foot less for females Weight: Males weigh about 175 to 250 pounds. Females weigh about 150 to 225 pounds.</p>
     <p>An adult panda can weigh up to 150kg, with males 10% larger and 20% heavier than females. They have two unique physical features that help them to hold, crush and eat bamboo: Broad, flat molar teeth Enlarged wrist bone that functions as an opposable thumb</p>
   <p>Giant pandas spend their lives eating bamboo and walking around the forest floor. They are good climbers and can also swim. They don’t build dens (except to put cubs in) or hibernate. They prefer shallow slopes and solitary living. If it is too cold up in the mountains they head down to the valleys where it is warmer.</p>
